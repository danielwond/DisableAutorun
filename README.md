This program is a simple tool for Windows computers that lets you control whether or not programs automatically run (Autorun) when you plug in a removable drive like a USB flash drive. It has a button and labels on a window that show you the current setting (enabled or disabled) and lets you change it with a click. When you change the setting, the program makes adjustments in the computer's registry, which is a database of settings. It's important to be careful when making changes to the registry, but this program can help you disable Autorun which might be useful for security reasons since it can prevent unknown programs from running automatically. However, it's also worth noting that disabling Autorun might also prevent some helpful programs from running when you insert a drive.
